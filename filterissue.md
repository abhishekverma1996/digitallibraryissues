# Issue: Filter Section Not Working in Digital Library

**WebPage:** [AddDigitalContent](https://digitallib.mssplonline.com/AddDigitalContent)

**Description:**

The filter section on the `AddDigitalContent` page is not functioning as expected. When a user selects a **column**, chooses an **operator**, enters a **value**, and clicks **Apply**, the filtering does not work correctly. This behavior is inconsistent with how it worked previously.

1. Navigate to: [AddDigitalContent](https://digitallib.mssplonline.com/AddDigitalContent)
2. Open the **Filter** section.
3. Select a **Column** from the dropdown.
4. Choose an **Operator** (e.g., equals, contains, greater than).
5. Enter a **Value** in the input field.
6. Click **Apply**.
7. Observe that the data is **not filtered correctly**.
